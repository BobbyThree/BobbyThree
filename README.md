### I love JavaScript and I don't care who knows it!

 I especially have an affinity for building things with Vanilla JavaScript without the use of frameworks. This has helped me gain a deeper insight into how things work under the hood. I do use frameworks, and have nothing against using them, but I have very much enjoyed building things from scratch such as particle system animations, webpages/web apps, games and audio software. I build things that enrich my life-long experience as a visual artist and a musician. 
 
 Lately I've been having fun with HTML Canvas while also exploring a bit of back end with NodeJS, ExpressJS and mySQL.

 I am looking to join a team of programmers either in Web Dev or Game Dev. I code for the love of it but I am ready to make a career out of it. I feel it's time to put my skills to good use toward a company and its consumers.
